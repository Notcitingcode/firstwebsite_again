                        Hi, I'm Ajezh Rajanihanth. I'm a ██ year old student who enjoys coding, gaming, art, video editing, and more! I created this website to showcase my work and to challenge myself. I hope you enjoy your stay here.
                    </p>

                        I suffer from teddybear_syndrome. Which basically means, images of me turn into teddy bears. These pictures also sometimes break the laws of the website. It's a rare condition, but I'm learning to live with it. <br><br>I'm also learning to live with the fact that I'm not a very good artist. But hey, I'm trying. <hr>I'm also trying to learn how to code, and I'm trying to learn how to make games. I'm trying a lot of things. I'm trying to learn how to be a better person. I'm trying to learn how to be happy. I'm trying to learn how to be me. I'm trying to learn how to be Ajezh. I'm trying to learn how to be Ajezh Rajanihanth. I'm trying to learn how to be Ajezh Rajanihanth, the creator of Ajezh.net. I'm trying to learn how to be Ajezh Rajanihanth, the creator of Ajezh.net, the website you're on right now. I'm trying to learn how to be Ajezh Rajanihanth, the creator of Ajezh.net, the website you're on right now, reading this very text.

                    <p> That’s right! I, Ajezh <i>(Uh-jeesh)</i> have created a website! Whether you know me as a friend, acquaintance, teacher, or <i>mortal enemy</i>. Eventually, you’ll see this very page, because I’ll show you! Now, I’ve already ended ¾ of these sentences with exclamation marks, so let’s get into the actual stuff. The <strong>what</strong>, and the <strong>why</strong>. </p>
                    <h3>The History behind this place</h3>
                    <p> So, Ajezh.net started as a passion project that I have actually been doing for a little while. It started when my dad first introduced me to HTML5 - the first coding language I ever learned. One day, he said I should make a website. So, I did! We called it <i>Ajezh.net…</i>  that was 5 years ago… so much has changed since then... i was the valedictorian. i became a sophisticated individual. i learned so much more when it came to the world of coding. <i>But</i>, this website always came back to me. Something I should do, eventually. Every year, on my birthday, I create a webpage stating my coding acknowledgments, and what I wanted to do in the future. 2024 wasn’t a big year for coding, but I still wanted to put something on the website. <strong><i>You know what came next…</i></strong></p>
                    <h3>Okay, but what actually is this?</h3>
                    <p>Ajezh.net is just a place where I can post a bunch of goofy nonsense. Some of the nonsense that will be here is cool, like video games, and my blog. Other stuff here is literal nonsense. Such as my <i>Book of Nonsense</i>. Some of the stuff here will be polished, other stuff will literally be written in the default Times New Roman, size 12, white background, default of doom. One thing is for certain however, none of the stuff here will be consistent. What does that mean? Well, scroll up, back to the heading. Now look behind the big Ajezh.net sign. It's pixel art. Now, look at the rest of the page… gradients. A lot of the pages on this website will be in different styles. I actually really like this idea, because it not only gives me room to grow as a developer. But, it also works as a gimmick for this place... <br><br> <i>also i can add <span class="vertical">lore...</span></i></p>
                    <h3>Jlhzly Jfwoly...</h3>
                    <p>No, but seriously, <i>well un-seriously</i>. You could find something really dumb, or find something quite thought provoking here. You could see something odd, or something smart here. You could find someone odd, or someone smart here. Well, not really a someone... So, keep your expectations low, but you expectations high! <br> Have fun!</p>

                <h6><strong>© 2021 Ajezh.net</strong><br> Just to be clear, although this website is pretty cool <i>(ugh obnoxious)</i>, it shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's just a fun and challenging coding project I wanted to do, and well.. I did it. If you believe hard enough, and put in the work. Like, a lot of work. Anything is possible... except for good grades. <br> One more thing, you shouldn't expect other pages on this site to be as <i>polished</i> as this one. <i>But, I'll try.</i> <br>.. / ... . . / -.-- --- ..- .-.-.- / -- --- .-. ... . / -.-. --- -.. . / .--. .-. --- .-.-.- / -.. --- -. .----. - / -. . . -.. / - .... .- - / .... . .-. . .-.-.- / -.. --- . ... / - .... . / --- -. . / .-- .-. .. - .. -. --. / - .... . ... . / .... .- ...- . / .- / -. .- -- . ..--.. / .-- .... --- / ... .- -.-- ... / .. - .----. ... / .- / --- -. . .-.-.-</h6>
