            Hey there random viewer. This website is the culmination of many projects and thoughts a random dude on the internet has created. He goes by the name Ajezh [uh-jeesh]. The contents of this website have been created with no place to be stored. This is that place... cold, hard HTML. The purpose of this place is to be something of which the creator can look back upon and view the progress they've made. Sometimes I wonder if this will ever be uploaded to the internet... <br><br> Get ready to get lost in this place. Find journal entries, games, social media, and much more in this interface. That was a crude attempt at a rhyme. Well, there's more oppertunities for it next time! But seriously, be prepared to be overwhelmed; this was made at 11:31 PM [3/1/2025] [M/D/Y]
